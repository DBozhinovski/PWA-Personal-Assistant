# A PWA Personal Assistant App

This is the repo for a series of articles I wrote on [gun.io](https://www.gun.io/blog). 
The repo contains a PWA for an offline-capable chabot, that would very much like to be a personal assistant when it grows up :)

## Getting started

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` # or `vite dev`, if you happen to have vite installed

## Building

- Run `npm run build` # or `vite build`

## Deployment

Just upload the dist directory after building on any static file server. Make sure to have a working SSL cert. configured, for the application to be
considered a PWA.
